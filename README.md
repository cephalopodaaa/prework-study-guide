# Basic Web-dev Notes (prework Study Guide)


## Description
A study guide for course pre-work to accompany the coding bootcamp program. These notes will be beneficial to anyone interested in learning the skills required do build their own webpage. It contains a very basic walkthrough to set up your own webpage using Github, which is a free-to-use online storage solution.


## Installation
To aid you with your web dev. I would recommend you install VS Code. This is a highly sophisticated text-editor which will be useful in your web-dev journey.

## Usage

This course will include:
- HTML
    This is the top level coding language for web design. It is where all the content of the web page lives, and holds the structure for all the code that creates the webpage.
- CSS
    This 'styles' the webpage, adding colour, fonts and sizes to the webpage. Any image or position formating will happen here too.
- JavaScript
    This is where all the cool stuff happens. Anything that requires an algorithm, or complex programs happen here. You can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

- Git
    This is the language used to perform functions on the github cloud-based storage platform.
